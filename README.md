Hello Guys..


# aab-to-apk-by-vjlu
a tool written with vb.net based on bundletool.jar and java, very fast, very quick, 3 clicks only.
-----------------------------------------------
dependencies:-
Java from here https://www.java.com/en/download/
(the tool is based on bundletool.jar by google https://github.com/google/bundletool/releases )
meaning in order for it to work at all, JAVA HAS TO BE INSTALLED.
-----------------------------------------------




-----------------------------------------------
Keystore :-
you can use your own .Keystore file, but just in case you don't have one, it's easy to
generate one from inside the tool (you don't need android studio), there is a button called Generate a keystore click it
and answer the questions truthfully, the Keystore file will be stored inside the Installation path
of the tool, you can select it again from inside the tool after you create it.
